## Overview
The COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard throws light into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. The dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to analyze the figures related to COVID-19 confirmed cases, recoveries, active cases and deaths country-wise/WHO region-wise.


## Dashboard Features

* Slicers to select Countries and WHO regions. 
* A map showing affected regions.
* Cards showing confirmed, recovered, active and death cases
* Bar charts and Pie charts showing the most affected countries.
* New Cases are separately listed using a bookmark.
* A few measures are added to derive more insights:
  _ Case Fatality Rate - CFR
  _ Recovery Rate - RR
  _ Severity
  _ Hike in cases during last week

The dashboard enables us to observe the dynamic trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, enabling a deeper understanding of the pandemic's progression. Using the map, we are able to visualize the geographic distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases across different countries and regions, with the bubble size showing how worst the spread was, providing a clear overview of highly affected areas. The calculated measures help in drilling down to derive the key trends of pandemic.
